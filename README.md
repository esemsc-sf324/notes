# Numerical Programming in Python

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Design reproducible code to solve numerical problems using the Python programming language.
2.	Compare algorithms based on their theoretical and practical properties, and select appropriately.
3.	Identify and correct different sources of error in numerical code and find ways to test for them.
4.	Analyse and interpret Earth Science problems using numerical codes.

## Module Content

The module will include cover the following topics:
1.	Students will be taught how to program in Python and how to use a range of Python modules to perform compute-intensive and data-intensive tasks. 
2.	Debugging and validation techniques to identify errors in code and prove that algorithms will operate correctly.
3.	A discussion of fundamentals of algorithmic analysis, with concrete examples chosen for their relevance to data processing.
4.	A discussion of the techniques used to finitely represent numbers in computer programs and the possible errors this can introduce.

## Downloading this repository.

We do *not* recommend using the "Download ZIP" button on the GitHub page for this repository. This will download a snapshot of the repository, but will not allow you to update it as the course progresses and new material is released. There are several better options you can use instead (pick **one** of the following):

- If you are (or wish to become) comfortable with the `git` command line tool, you should follow the following strategy:
   - either create a classic [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) (also known as a PAT),
   - or create [an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
   - then clone the repository using `git clone` and the appropriate URL
      - `https://github.com/ese-ada-lovelace-2024/numerical-programming-in-python.git`, using your PAT as your password
      - `git@github.com:ese-msc-2023/modern-programming-methods.git` using your SSH key.
- If you are not (yet) comfortable with the command line, you can use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application to clone the repository. You may need to create a PAT as above, and use it as your password when prompted.
- The [GitHub command line tool](https://cli.github.com/) is also an option, but may not be suitable for beginners.
