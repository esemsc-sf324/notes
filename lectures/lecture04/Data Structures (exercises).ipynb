    "\n",

The solution here is to use `repeat`, so for each iteration, the setup code will be run, before the timer starts, then the append operation is timed, before we start all over again.\n",

    "This will return a list with a time for each iteration. In this example, there will be 100 times in that list. You can inspect these yourself, the most interesting values will be the mean and minimum in the list. The minimum is interesting as that will be a good indication of how quickly things _can_ run on your computer. If there is lots of variation in those times, you may need to increase `repeat` to a larger number to get some meaningful results."
